[cite_start]I am a Research Assistant at the Department of Building Engineering and Construction Management at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET). [cite: 3] [cite_start]My research focuses on sustainable and high-performance construction materials, including the development of high-strength concrete using graphene and hybrid fibers. [cite: 3, 8] [cite_start]I specialize in applying machine learning techniques to predict and optimize the properties of concrete, utilizing SHAP and PDP analysis for advanced model interpretation. [cite: 10, 12, 14, 15]

[cite_start]I have authored and co-authored several research articles in peer-reviewed journals, including Elsevier's *Journal of Materials Research and Technology* [cite: 8][cite_start], *Construction & Building Materials* [cite: 11][cite_start], and *Cleaner Engineering and Technology*[cite: 13]. [cite_start]Additionally, I have presented my research at international conferences such as ICCESD 2024. [cite: 18, 20]
